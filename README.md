# ChuckNorris-Facts
 An angular app to generate Chuck Norris facts.

 This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) 9.1.1.
 and [angular-redux/store](https://github.com/angular-redux/platform/tree/master/packages/store) was used for app state management. 

I would recommend to use [Redux DevTools Chrome Extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) to monitor the state. 

Check [package.json](https://github.com/amirzarepashaei/ChuckNorris-Facts/blob/master/app/package.json) for dependencies. 

This app gets a list of Chcuk Norris facts based on specific categories. 

## To run the app
`cd app`
`sudo npm i`
`ng serve --open` 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
